### Ingredients (1-2 people):  

- 2 ripe bananas
- 1/2 tbsp maple syrup¹
- 120 g self-raising flour²
- 150 ml soy milk³
- 1/2 tbsp olive oil

Mash the bananas in a bowl with a fork until it becomes liquidly, then add the
olive oil, self-raising flour, soy milk, maple syrup, and mix everything
together with a spoon. Once everything is mixed you could add some blueberries,
but that's optional. Heat up a non-stick pan and add a tiny bit of oil (I dapped
a paper cloth in a bit of oil and lightly applied it to the pan). Once it's hot,
add the batter and wait for ~2-3 minutes until it starts showing small holes.
Flip it and wait another minute or so. Repeat until the batter is used up.

Serve with maple syrup, some blueberries, sliced bananas or any of your
preferred toppings.

¹ You can probably also use agave syrup or some other sweetener.  
² Oat flour + baking powder probably works too (and is a lot healthier).  
³ Or other plant-based milks.
